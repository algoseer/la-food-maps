Goal : To plot a zipcode level map of restaurant cuisines in LA

### Data sources

* LA county restaurant and market inspections [link] (https://data.lacounty.gov/Health/LOS-ANGELES-COUNTY-RESTAURANT-AND-MARKET-INSPECTIO/6ni6-h5kp)
* Zipcode boundaries from LAtimes crime data [link] (https://confcats-event-sessions.s3.amazonaws.com/icassp20/videos/1132-1132-20200415-000000-20200415-000000.mp4
)
* Restaurant data from Yelp [API] (https://www.yelp.com/fusion)

Simple plot example using folium choropleths to plot keyword frequency on names from inspections data.

**2_sort_by_restaurants.py**

Rearranges inspections data by restaurants aggregating multiple inspections at the same restaurants.
This will be used to query the Yelp Fusion API.

**3_collate_by_zipcode.py**

**5_plot_zipcode_catgories.py**
